 Cellular Component," Note that, in addition to forming the root of the cellular component ontology, this term is recommended for use for the annotation of gene products whose cellular component is unknown. When this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the cellular component of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code 'no data' (ND), is used to indicate this."," A location, relative to cellular compartments and structures, occupied by a macromolecular machine when it carries out a molecular function. There are two ways in which the gene ontology describes locations of gene products: (1) relative to cellular structures (e.g., cytoplasmic side of plasma membrane) or compartments (e.g., mitochondrion), and (2) the stable macromolecular complexes of which they are parts (e.g., the ribosome).",GO:0000002, GO:0008372,, cell or subcellular entity | cellular component | subcellular entity, cellular_component
 Cellular Component," Note that this term is intended to annotate gene products that are not attached to the cell surface. For gene products from multicellular organisms which are secreted from a cell but retained within the organism (i.e. released into the interstitial fluid or blood), consider the cellular component term 'extracellular space ; GO:0005615'.", The space external to the outermost structure of a cell. For cells without external protective or external encapsulating structures this refers to space outside of the plasma membrane. This term covers the host cell environment outside an intracellular parasite., GO:0005576,, is-a cellular anatomical entity, extracellular, extracellular region
 Cellular Component,," The living contents of a cell; the matter contained within (but not including) the plasma membrane, usually taken to exclude large vacuoles and masses of secretory or ingested material. In eukaryotes it includes the nucleus and cytoplasm.", GO:0005622,, is-a cellular_component, internal to cell | nucleocytoplasm | protoplasm | protoplast, intracellular
 Cellular Component,, A structure composed of peptidoglycan and often chitin in addition to other materials. It usually forms perpendicular to the long axis of a cell or hypha and grows centripetally from the cell wall to the center of the cell and often functions in the compartmentalization of a cell into two daughter cells., GO:0030428,, is-a cellular anatomical entity, cross wall | septum, cell septum
 Cellular Component,," A viscous, carbohydrate rich layer at the outermost periphery of a cell.", GO:0030112,, part-of cell envelope is-a external encapsulating structure, cell capsule, glycocalyx
 Cellular Component,," A protective structure outside the cytoplasmic membrane composed of peptidoglycan (also known as murein), a molecule made up of a glycan (sugar) backbone of repetitively alternating N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid with short, attached, cross-linked peptide chains containing unusual amino acids. An example of this component is found in Escherichia coli.", GO:0009274,, is-a cell wall, envelope | murein sacculus | peptidoglycan, peptidoglycan-based cell wall
 Cellular Component,," A rigid yet dynamic structure surrounding the plasma membrane that affords protection from stresses and contributes to cell morphogenesis, consisting of extensively cross-linked glycoproteins and carbohydrates. The glycoproteins may be modified with N- or O-linked carbohydrates, or glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors; the polysaccharides are primarily branched glucans, including beta-linked and alpha-linked glucans, and may also include chitin and other carbohydrate polymers, but not cellulose or pectin. Enzymes involved in cell wall biosynthesis are also found in the cell wall. Note that some forms of fungi develop a capsule outside of the cell wall under certain circumstances; this is considered a separate structure.", GO:0009277,, is-a cell wall, beta-glucan-containing cell wall | chitin- and beta-glucan-containing cell wall | chitin-containing cell wall, fungal-type cell wall
 Cellular Component,, A more or less rigid stucture lying outside the cell membrane of a cell and composed of cellulose and pectin and other organic and inorganic substances., GO:0009505,, is-a cell wall, cellulose and pectin-containing cell wall | plant cell wall, plant-type cell wall
 Cellular Component,," A protein complex composed of six subunits of C1q, each formed of the three homologous polypeptide chains C1QA, C1QB, and C1QB, and tetramer of two C1QR and two C1QS polypeptide chains.", GO:0005602,, part-of extracellular space is-a protein-containing complex, complement component C1q complex, complement component C1 complex
